Lydia    is    dead.    But    they    don't    know    this    yet.    1977,    May    3,    six    thirty    in    the    morning,    no    one    knows    anything    but    this    innocuous    fact:    Lydia    is    late    for    breakfast.    As    always,    next    to    her    cereal    bowl,    her    mother    has    placed    a    sharpened    pencil    and    Lydia's    physics    homework,    six    problems    flagged    with    small    ticks.    Driving    to    work,    Lydia's    father    nudges    the    dial    toward    WXKP,    Northwest    Ohio's    Best    News    Source,    vexed    by    the    crackles    of    static.    On    the    stairs,    Lydia's    brother    yawns,    still    twined    in    the    tail    end    of    his    dream.    And    in    her    chair    in    the    corner    of    the    kitchen,    Lydia's    sister    hunches    moon-eyed    over    her    cornflakes,    sucking    them    to    pieces    one    by    one,    waiting    for    Lydia    to    appear.    It's    she    who    says,    at    last,    "Lydia's    taking    a    long    time    today."    


Lydia is dead. But they don't know this yet. 1977,
    May 3, six thirty in the morning, no one knows
   anything but this innocuous fact: Lydia is late
for breakfast. As always, next to her cereal bowl,
      her mother has placed a sharpened pencil and
    Lydia's physics homework, six problems flagged
 with small ticks. Driving to work, Lydia's father
nudges the dial toward WXKP, Northwest Ohio's Best
  News Source, vexed by the crackles of static. On
the stairs, Lydia's brother yawns, still twined in
the tail end of his dream. And in her chair in the
     corner of the kitchen, Lydia's sister hunches
    moon-eyed over her cornflakes, sucking them to
   pieces one by one, waiting for Lydia to appear.
It's she who says, at last, "Lydia's taking a long
                                      time today."
